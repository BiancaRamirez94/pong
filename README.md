Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game consists of two paddles and a ball that bounces back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from going past your paddle, and to score points by making the ball go past your opponent's paddle.

Gameplay
The game is controlled using the following keys:

Player 1 (left paddle): "w" to move up, "s" to move down
